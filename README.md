### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

SNHU Computer Science Program

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

To be able to set events with dates and times uniquely to each username that is created and signed in.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why 
were your designs successful?

There is a sign in screen, creating a username, calendar screen, and creating an event.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I started by grasping an understanding of the system requirments. Then I developed layouts to fit all needed screens. The I developed the code.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I should have written test cases and suites, but i simply relyed on printing the needed information in a textview and visually inspecting for 
errors from the printout.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

In creating a unique database per username i hade to create a second database that stored username as a column, then the plan was to query based from username.
    
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

The username and password I believe greatly showed my success. There was also the function of converting the calendarview from its normal long to a date that 
can be recognized, instead of miliseconds
